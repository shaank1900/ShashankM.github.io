          India consistently ranks among the countries with the highest levels of ambient air pollution worldwide.
          At the same time, it faces significant challenges in neonatal health, with newborns having low birth
          weights which has been shown to have long-term impacts on health and labor market outcomes. Using data
          from the Indian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), we examine the impact of in-utero exposure to
          particulate matter (PM2.5) on birth outcomes. We exploit quasi-random variation in wind direction as an
          instrument for in-utero particulate matter exposure for each child. We find that reducing in-utero PM2.5
          exposure by one standard deviation would lead to a 1.1% increase in average birth weight and reduce the
          incidence of low birth weight (LBW) and very low birth weight (VLBW) births by 2.9 and 0.7 percentage
          points, respectively. We extend our analysis to examine potential nonlinear effects of pollution exposure
          on birth outcomes. While we find no evidence of heterogeneous effects across different pollution thresholds,
          our results indicate that pollution disproportionately affects individuals in the lower tail of the birth
          weight distribution, with no impact at the upper tail.

        How do I Rank Myself? Perceived Economic Positions and Personality Traits

        <p>
          We use unique survey data to study how people perceive their position in the national income,
          wealth, and (future) pension income distribution in the Netherlands. Combining our survey data
          with administrative records, we find a strong center bias across all three domains. Individuals
          who are objectively lower ranked consistently overestimate their standing, while those ranked
          higher tend to underestimate theirs. We then investigate the difference between perceived and
          actual economic rank, focusing on the role of personality traits. Our analysis reveals that
          conditional on objective rank, the traits of neuroticism and extraversion play a salient role.
          Individuals high in neuroticism consistently underestimate their position in the income, wealth,
          and pension distributions, while those high in extraversion tend to overestimate theirs. Our results
          are not purely driven by the mechanical nature of “center bias”, since neurotic individuals already
          tend to be lower ranked yet still underestimate, and extraverts tend to be higher ranked yet still
          overestimate their position. These findings suggest that personality traits contribute in a systematic
          and measurable way to how individuals form beliefs about themselves within the economic hierarchy.
